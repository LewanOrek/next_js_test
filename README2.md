## ‚ú® Features

The platform is divided into two main parts: a powerful admin dashboard and a user-facing contest interface.

### For Administrators:
- **Full Contest Management:** Create, edit, and manage contests with specific start/end times.
- **Flexible Access Control:** Set contests to be `Public`, `Private`, or `Invite-Only` with a secure invite link system.
- **Problem & Test Case Management:** Add problems with PDF statements, manage individual test cases with expected answers, and control problem visibility.
- **User Moderation:** View, filter, and paginate through users. Manage their accounts by verifying, banning, or changing roles.
- **Live Communication:** Post public announcements for each contest, with support for pinning important messages.
- **In-Depth Analytics:** A dedicated dashboard with charts to monitor user registrations, contest popularity, and problem difficulty.

### For Participants:
- **Personalized Dashboard:** View active contests, track total points, and see a history of recent submissions.
- **Secure Authentication:** Full auth system including registration, email verification, and password reset.
- **Clear Contest Interface:** Easily browse available contests, view problems, download assets, and submit answers.
- **Detailed Submission History:** Review all your past submissions for a contest, including the verdict and points awarded.
- **Live Leaderboards:** See real-time rankings for each contest, broken down by total score and points per problem.
- **Q&A System:** Ask questions about the contest and receive answers from administrators.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running a local Redis instance)
-   A PostgreSQL database. You can get a free one from [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hostek/math-contest.git
    cd math-contest/web
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    yarn env
    ```

4.  **Set up the database:**
    -   Run the Prisma migrations to create the database schema.
        ```bash
        npx prisma migrate dev
        ```

5.  **Seed the database with initial data:**
    -   This script will create a default admin user and 100 fake users for testing.
        ```bash
        npx prisma db seed
        ```
    -   **Admin credentials:** `admin@admin.com` / `admin`

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
